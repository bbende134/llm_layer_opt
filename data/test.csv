Buyer: Awesome, how about the neighborhood and schools what are they like?
Seller: Well you'll be in a close proximity to most shopping centers, and the schools are in a decent range. Most of the children in the neighborhood take the school bus home, and it doesn't seem to be an issue for them.

Buyer: It's definitely an attractive place, but it's one of several I'm looking at.  I've seen similar ads priced as low at $1500.
Seller: That may be, but this house has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a 2 car garage. It also comes with a washer/dryer/dishwasher/stove and oven, and has a large patio and backyard. The yard is also mowed and maintained by my associate, so you never have to worry about doing yard work
Buyer: Ooh, I like the sound of that.  Yard work is a pain.  How about $2000, and I'll sign a 2 year lease.  Anything more than that is really out of my price range. 
Seller: That is a little low, I have many people that are interested in the rental. But if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease, I can do $3200 per month
Buyer: I'm neat, don't throw wild parties, non-smoker, and no pets.  I might be able to swing 2300, but that's as high as I can go. 
Seller: You sound like you would make a great tenant. I can meet you in the middle at $2800, but I honestly can't go any higher
Buyer: Can you do $2600?  As it is, I'm going to be eating ramen for a while.

Seller: we do offer swimming privileges with rent
Buyer: Ok that all sounds really good. But for those amenities and the location, I'm told the rent really should be closer to the $2000 range so I'm wondering what I'm missing that is making the rate so high even with the small $200 discount...

We offer all applkiances already built into the home as well as granite countertops, walk in closets, oversized soaking tubs and a spacious area to live with `19ft lofts.

"Buyer: Hello there! I'm interested in the dresser. What kind of wood is it made from?
Seller: It is made from walnut wood. 
Buyer: How many drawers? Does it have any scratches?
Seller: The dresser has 6 drawers.   It does have some chips around the edges and some marks on the top surface.  But looks great.
Buyer: Would you be able to come down on price at all? Would you be able to do $385?
Seller: Man that's awful low. It is in good vintage condition. And the going rate is much higher among vintage furniture collectors.  How about 525?
Buyer: I could do $525 if you could deliver it?
Seller: I would be happy to deliver it.    ",3,furniture

"Seller: Hi there!  I'm selling my Bridgetone 16"" bike.  It's in good condition and available for only $110.  Are you interested?
Buyer: I am very interested but that price is a bit high. What condition is th ebike in
Seller: It's in good condition.  It has always been stored indoors, so no rust or chipping.  
Buyer: Are the tires in good condition? I see they are original ones
Seller: They are the original, but to be honest, I never rode it very often.  There is still a good amount of tread on them, so there's many more miles to go before they'll need to be replaced.
Buyer: That sounds great. How about we settle for 99 and Ill pick it up today
Seller: That works for me!  ",0,bike
