Seller: Would you be willing to do $20?
Buyer: No, I have to stay firm at $15, there's a good chance that the phone is in a permanent bootloop state that I can't do anything to recover, and then I'd have to just recycle it.

Seller: Truth be told. My initial sale price for this is much, much higher. It's $340. We need to talk this out.
Buyer: well they list at office max for $299 and this one is used. so the highest i would go is about $225
Seller: More accurately, though, this is refurbished. I only ""unboxed"" the package, and intermittently used it. Meaning the quality of it is still considerably higher than a used chair. $225 is severely underselling it. I want $275 because the condition is too close to new.
Buyer: im sorry i cannot go that high $227 is im highest offer take it or leave it
Seller: I have a counteroffer. $235 is the absolute lowest I can go on my part. If you buy a used chair anywhere else, it will not be as great of a condition as this.",3,furniture

Buyer: That sounds great. That countertop looks very outdated. I am stuck at 1350 but if the countertop was updated I could probably go much higher...
Seller: Well, we are not finished updating just yet.We still have to do the kitchen.  It's available on July 1st so we still have some time to replace it.  What's the highest you think you could go?
Buyer: I think 1750 would be fair with a new countertop.
Seller: I really couldn't let it go for less than the 2250 asking price.  I am remodeling more than just the counter.  New carpet, new appliances, freshly painted and I put in an energy efficient HVAC so your utility bills will be lower.
Buyer: That all sounds great but like I said I am limited by a very very low budget. I can forego the new countertop though if it means a fairer price.
Seller: How would you feel if I waived the first month's rent, but you have to agree to a 12 month lease?

"Buyer: Hello are you there?
Seller: Yes, I am here to discuss with you the room?
Buyer: Yes, the room seems adequate for my needs but the payment seems much too high. I want to shoot you another offer, I'm thinking 1300 is more than reasonable.
Seller: I see where you are coming from, but given the location of the unit I find this to be a competitive price so going that low is just not possible at the moment. Is there any question you have about the unit?
Buyer: Well I see it's near Berkeley, but I was wondering exactly how close it is to say restaurants around the area and how convenient it would be to travel around?
Seller: Being one mile from West Berkley Bowl, it should be easy to find food. Even if you don't have transporation, there is major bus lines just a few blocks away and should be quite accessable.
Buyer: Ah okay I see, well in the case I can understand the price but I am still on a tight budget. I am really looking to spend no more than 1410 for the room.
Seller: Well I am really trying to stay within 2000 dollars and not go much further than that, the room is highly sought after.
Buyer: I understand, can we settle for somewhere in-between maybe 1800?
Seller: I'm afraid the lowest I can possible go is 1900. Woudl thsi work for you?
Buyer: It's higher than I would like but I suppose that's very reasonable. I will accept the price of 1900.

Seller: Great , What can I tell you about it
Buyer: Do you have any flexibility on your pet policy?
Seller: I don't really mind all pets, if it is a cat or a  small dog that is quiet I usually will let you have it there but there is an additional fee of 25.00 per month.
Buyer: Okay thank you. I do not have any pets but it's a good option to have in the future. The price is a little high for my budget at the moment. Would you be willing to lower the price if I pay water utilities? 
Seller: The utilities are included so no need to do that. I could lower the price to 1950 a month and just charge you one month security instead of a month and a half if that helps.
Buyer: My budget really allows for around $1500 right now.
Seller: That is really low for me to accept, the lowest I could go is 1700. I could divide the security deposit over several months so you would not have to pay it all at one time before moving in.
Buyer: Okay I appreciate the flexibility. Let's do that. Where do we start?

Buyer: i know that you are not high! well, i am a young broke college student. i was able to save some of my financial aid money in order to buy this very nice car. i really need it.

"Seller: Hi there!
Buyer: Hello! I was just looking at your ad for the typing desk. I didn't see a photo, but was wondering if I might be able to ask a few questions about it. What are the dimensions? Can you tell me the condition?
Seller: Sure! It's a wonderful vintage typing desk. It's 47"" long, 26.5"" high and has a depth of 18.5"". It's in good condition with beveled wood drawers and chrome wheels. I hate to get rid of it but I'm downsizing and won't have room for it.
Buyer: I completely understand! I think I saw one just like it at a flea market recently, but the price was a bit lower...would you be willing to take $70.00 cash if I come today to get it?
Seller: Oh, I don't know if the one you saw was like this. It's a Danish vintage typing desk. I would be willing to go down to $100 if you paid in cash.
Buyer: I can't go that high right now...I'm sorry. The best I can do would be $80.
Seller: You know, I have a chair that I use with this desk that I really won't need anymore...I can throw it in with the desk if we can go to $85. Would that work?

Buyer: sitting for 10 years must have really hurt the car.  I could use some parts, though.  What's the asking price?

Buyer: I am sorry. $2000 is the most I can do. 
Seller: i believe we are at an impass then.
Buyer: No worries. I'll keep finding the right house
